--- April 13th ---
restarting the project
gonna start with git and try to commit something

the only thing I did for the project was before the holidays and I struggled to install it for 3 days
loged my work in google keep

%%todo: move the log on google keep to here.

^ git ^
seems we got the basics working
1. use git config --global user.email <email> and user.name <name> to set up my stuff
2. use git commit -m <massage>
3. use git log to view basics of logs ... my stuff are after the origin thing with red
4. use git add to add files and git status to check if everything is cool
>>> use cheat sheets and shit to learn more

all the answers for qestion 1 are obvious
