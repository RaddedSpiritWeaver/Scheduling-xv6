restarting the project
gonna start with git and try to commit something

the only thing I did for the project was before the holidays and I struggled to install it for 3 days
loged my work in google keep

%%todo: move the log on google keep to here.

^ git ^
seems we got the basics working
1. use git config --global user.email <email> and user.name <name> to set up my stuff
2. use git commit -m <massage>
3. use git log to view basics of logs ... my stuff are after the origin thing with red
4. use git add to add files and git status to check if everything is cool
>>> use cheat sheets and shit to learn more

. first of all we have to make qemu after each change in the code maybe there is some thing else but i have no idea atm

????? Questions of the Day ?????

sysfile.c --> seems to contain the code for system calls but mappings were on other files and header files as i was browsing the ssytem files

string.c --> has some memory management stuff available in it


mp.c --> also has somethings about sharing memory and stuff

1. can i hot load file changes? (guess its a no since the system is already running)
2. how is qemu actually made? why do i get my complie error when i load it? are the files and headers i need in qemu floder or in xv6 ? the c libraries i need to do my work? what is the actual struct ?
